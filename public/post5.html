            Stocks represent shares of ownership in a company, and are listed for sale on a specific exchange. Exchanges
            track the supply and demand — and directly related, the price — of each stock. They also bring buyers and
            sellers together and act as a market for the shares of those companies. The stock market is made up of
            exchanges, such as the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq. <br>

            When you go to "invest in the stock market," you're not purchasing a piece of the stock market itself;
            you're purchasing stocks that are listed on those exchanges that make up the stock market.
        <h3> Need to back up a bit?</h3>
        Individual traders are typically represented by brokers — these days, that’s often an online broker. You place
        your stock trades through the broker, which then deals with the exchange on your behalf. <br>

        The NYSE and the Nasdaq are open from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Eastern. If those hours don't work for you, some
        brokers do offer premarket and after-hours trading sessions. <br>

        When you get started, stock trading information can sound like gibberish. But if you’re investing long term —
        with, say, a 401(k) or IRA geared toward retirement — you can get by just fine without understanding the stock
        market much at all, as long as you figure out how much you need to invest for retirement. <br>

        If, on the other hand, you want to learn how to trade stocks, you do need to understand the stock market, and at
        least some basic information about how stock trading works. <br>
        <h3>Understanding the stock market</h3>
        When people refer to the stock market being up or down, they’re generally referring to one of the major market
        indexes. <br>

        A market index tracks the performance of a group of stocks, which either represents the market as a whole or a
        specific sector of the market, like technology or retail companies. You’re likely to hear most about the S&P
        500, the Nasdaq composite and the Dow Jones Industrial Average; they are often used as proxies for the
        performance of the overall market. On Jan. 22, 2024, for instance, the S&P 500, Dow Jones and Nasdaq rose to new
        record highs. <br>

        Investors use indexes to benchmark the performance of their own portfolios and, in some cases, to inform their
        stock trading decisions. You can also invest in an entire index through an index fund or exchange-traded fund,
        or ETF, which usually tracks a specific index or sector of the market.
