        <h1>Remote Work Pros And Cons That You Should Know</h1>
        <p>
            As most companies have seen a spike in remote work productivity[1], many organizations around the world are
            planning to go fully remote to provide their employees with a better work-life balance and save up on
            infrastructure costs. <br>

            But before you take the big plunge, it is important to know the pros and cons of working remotely.
        <h2>Remote Work Pros And Cons</h2>
        <h3>
            Remote work pros
        </h3>
        <h3>1. Better work-life balance</h3>
        Remote employees don’t need to spend hours in bumper to bumper traffic every day, which helps them spend more
        time with their family or take up a hobby. With enough rest and free time every day, employees focus better on
        their work which directly leads to higher productivity and efficiency.
        <h3>2. More freedom</h3>
        A traditional employee is expected to work from office 8-9 hours a day, every week. Employees can’t just run out
        for a personal errand or take an hour-long nap break because they aren’t able to focus on work. They can only do
        all that after work hours or by taking an official leave from work. <br>

        On the contrary, remote employees, especially those enjoying flexible work, get more freedom to create their own
        schedule. They can work during early mornings to get the rest of the day free or work through the nights if
        that’s when they feel the most productive. <br>

        When working remotely, the focus is on getting the work done instead of spending a fixed number of hours in
        front of the laptop screen every day.
        <h3>3. Improved employee experience</h3>
        With no daily commute, no excessive coffee breaks, and no long hours away from friends, family, and kids, remote
        work greatly improves employee experience and well-being. Offering optimum employee experience creates a culture
        of high performance and efficiency where employees actually want to improve and succeed at their work.
        <h3>4. Decreased business and infrastructure costs</h3>
        When fewer employees come to the office every day, you need fewer desks and equipment to support them. Moreover,
        you would also need a smaller space to accommodate all the employees coming to the office, leading to lowered
        rent costs. In fact, according to a study, organizations can save up to $2,000 for every employee[2] that goes
        remote by simply saving on their office space and overall infrastructure.
        <h3>5. Increase in productivity</h3>
        Unlike traditional office employees who might feel frustrated after spending an hour or two in the morning
        commute, remote employees feel more positive and fresh in the morning when they start their work. <br>

        Also, with no excessive coffee breaks or interruptions, employees can completely focus on their work, leading to
        an increase in productivity. In fact, over 75 percent of employees agree that they have fewer disruptions when
        they work away from the office, and 77 percent of them claim to be more productive while working from home(WFH
        Meaning).
        <h3>6. Ability to hire and retain top talent</h3>
        Over 83 percent[4] of employees claim that the ability to work remotely, at least in some capacity, is one of
        the major deciding factors when considering a job offer. 74 percent of employees would quit their jobs to work
        at an organization that allows them to go remote more often, even if their salary remained the same. <br>

        For organizations, that means, offering remote working perks is not an option anymore. It’s a necessity if they
        want to hire and retain top talent. Companies offering flexible working arrangements, whether it is in the form
        of full or partial remote work can make a big difference for the candidates looking for their next career move.
        <h1>Remote Work Cons</h1>
        <h3>1. No face-to-face connection</h3>
        With no face to face interactions or team meetings, it can be difficult for newly remote teams to work together.
        Managers worry that their team members might not work as efficiently as they did in the office (even though
        research[5] indicates otherwise). Similarly, employees can struggle due to reduced guidance and support from
        managers. In many cases, employees even feel left out when remote managers are out of touch with their needs and
        challenges. <br>

        How to avoid this: Managers can carefully plan weekly 1:1 meetings with each team member.
        <h3>2. Lack of access to information</h3>
        Without the right onboarding process or help, it can be challenging for remote employees to find and locate all
        the information they need to manage their work. On average, employees spend 30 percent[6] of their workday
        searching for information. While working remotely, this number gets further increased as employees are on their
        own and they can message their colleagues for help only so many times which invariably decreases productivity
        and employee engagement. <br>

        How to avoid this: Integrate a unified digital workplace platform to make it easier for the employees to access
        all the work-related data and applications.
        <h3>3. Decreased collaboration</h3>
        When teams work remotely, there are fewer chances of employees talking to each other about random day to day
        things over lunch or coffee break. While these conversations may seem unnecessary from a distance, they actually
        help improve team coordination and communication. <br>

        When remote teams strictly restrict their conversations to work with no informal chats, it makes team members
        feel uncomfortable in reaching out to their coworkers about any challenges or problems that might be affecting
        their work. <br>

        How to avoid this: Organize informal discussions with the whole team where everyone can connect and catch up on
        a personal level.
        <h3>4. Loneliness and isolation</h3>
        Going to the office every morning adds a structure and routine to people’s lives. In an office, you spend time
        with people around you and even talk to employees working in other departments as you take the elevator, grab a
        cup of coffee, or sit down for lunch.

        But working remotely all by yourself with just a laptop in front of you can be incredibly isolating and lonely.
        While some people choose to work through a coworking space or cafe to avoid loneliness, it isn’t really possible
        right now with social distancing norms in place. Continuous isolation with no engagement with the team can
        eventually lead to frustration, burnouts, and lowered efficiency. <br>
        How to avoid this: Routinely organize virtual team building activities for all the employees in the company.
        <h3>Is working remotely effective?</h3>
        While there are some clear advantages and disadvantages to remote work, the pros definitely outweigh the cons.
        Moreover, you can easily avoid all the disadvantages by establishing the right remote working strategies and
        equipping your employees with remote work tools that can help them stay productive and efficient even while
        working from home.
